# Design Patterns and Overengineering Analysis

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Factory Method Pattern
- **Purpose**: Creates objects without explicitly specifying their exact classes
- **Implementation**: PizzaFactory creates different pizza types
- **Benefit**: Encapsulates object creation logic

### 2. Decorator Pattern
- **Purpose**: Adds new behaviors to objects dynamically
- **Implementation**: Toppings wrap around base pizzas
- **Benefit**: Flexible way to extend functionality

### 3. Strategy Pattern
- **Purpose**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Implementation**: Different payment methods
- **Benefit**: Runtime switching between payment methods
